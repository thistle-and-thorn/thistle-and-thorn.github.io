These people run to their homes at the first sight of fire spreading across the plains, but they might not escape\nthe fire's path. The player can swap tiles in the world to create a natural barrier of water to keep the villages scattered\nacross the plains protected from the flames. If the player manages to save any villagers by the time the fire has spread as\nmuch as it can, the game progresses with a new map and new villagers to save.</p>\n<p>On a scale of 1-10, I think I would rate this a 3.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-did-we-do\"><a href=\"#what-did-we-do\" aria-label=\"what did we do permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What did we do?</h3>\n<p>This game was programmed over the course of 5 weekends, where Patrick and I met up for about 4-6 hours each Saturday. We\njumped into programming the game on day 1. At that point the design wasn't fully fleshed out, but we instead had a\ntile-swapping mechanic that I implemented in another project, and Patrick wanted to mess with Perlin noise. We wanted to\nimprove on those two pillars and see where we would go.</p>\n<p>The game design slowly grew in scope as we worked. We found at every turn the prototype just <em>wasn't fun</em>. We would shrug, hit\nour heads against the wall meekly, and guess at what might not be working and try to improve it. The game continued to diverge\nfrom the original idea: \"the player makes a bridge of gradient color across a noisy landscape\". The way we had decided to do\nthe tile-swapping and noise generation meant that the resolution was much too low to even see a \"landscape\" in a 12x12 grid.</p>\n<p>On the final weekend, I made some too-loud and too-simple \"dynamic\" music in about an hour, and Patrick worked on making the\nmenu screens and win states for the game. Working on that was like putting the metaphorical nail in the coffin - we wanted to\nbe done with the project even though we still had some cool ideas remaining. The extra trappings for the game needed a solid\nfoundation, so we needed to say we had finished the core mechanic. Patrick had just discovered that making the game turn-based\nmade the game more fun, but we had to say goodbye.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-went-well\"><a href=\"#what-went-well\" aria-label=\"what went well permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What went well?</h3>\n<h4 id=\"fast-iteration\"><a href=\"#fast-iteration\" aria-label=\"fast iteration permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Fast iteration</h4>\n<p>We were able to move really quickly and hash out multiple features in a half day of work. Each day felt like we made progress\nfor the game. This was a far cry from both of our day jobs. It was nice to be able to know that making each line perfect would\nbe a waste of our time, and it would be better to just press on and discover problems later. I think in that way, we hit \"bigger\"\nproblems more than small ones. We realize now that we need a better structure for our code, which we can add into the foundation\nof our next project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"pair-programming-for-foundational-code\"><a href=\"#pair-programming-for-foundational-code\" aria-label=\"pair programming for foundational code permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pair programming for foundational code</h4>\n<p>Even though I struggle to pay attention during pair programming, it was good to start the project out together instead of immediately\nsplitting off into separate areas.
